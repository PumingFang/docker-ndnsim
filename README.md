# ndnSIM

**Unofficial** docker implementation of [ndnSIM](http://ndnsim.net/)

The ndnSIM is NS-3 module that implements Named Data Networking (NDN)
communication model, the clean slate Internet design. ndnSIM is specially
optimized for simulation purposes and has a cleaner and more extensible internal
structure comparing to the existing NDN implementation (NDNx).
